# HealthCheckPlank
A great deal of importance is placed on ensuring that exercise is performed correctly. In this repo the joints of a person is extracted from a video by 'openpifpaf', then the angls of arms and back are calculated. 
For checking the correctness of 'PLANK', a rule-based method is implemented.

## Usage:


run main.py

## Parameters:
```
--path /path/to/source/video/
  
  
--save_path /path/to/ave/processed/frames/
  
  
--frame_rate /frame/rate/to/extract/the/video/frame>
```
